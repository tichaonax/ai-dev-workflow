# Three-Document Knowledge Base System

The AI Dev Workflow uses a comprehensive three-document approach to create a complete knowledge base for every completed task. This ensures maximum knowledge retention and enables effective future reference.

## üìö The Documentation Triad

When a task is completed, three documents are archived together in `ai-contexts/project-plans/completed/YYYY-MM/`:

### 1. üìã Project Plan (`projectplan-[ticket]-[description]-[date].md`)
**Purpose:** Execution roadmap and progress tracking
**Contains:**
- Task breakdown with checkboxes
- Phase-by-phase implementation plan
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Timeline and estimates
- Progress tracking (completed vs pending tasks)

### 2. üìù Requirements Context (`context-[ticket]-[description].md`)
**Purpose:** Original requirements and constraints
**Contains:**
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Business requirements and constraints
- Technical specifications
- Edge cases and considerations
- Stakeholder requirements

### 3. üìñ Final Documentation (`documentation-[ticket]-[description].md`)
**Purpose:** Implementation summary and knowledge capture
**Contains:**
- Executive Summary (what was built and why)
- Technical Implementation Details
- Key Decisions Made and Rationale
- Challenges Overcome and Solutions
- Testing Strategy and Coverage
- Performance Impact and Metrics
- Future Maintenance Notes
- Lessons Learned and Best Practices

## üîÑ Workflow Commands

### Enhanced DOCUMENT WORK Command

The `DOCUMENT WORK` command now creates comprehensive final documentation alongside commit messages:

```
DOCUMENT WORK
```

**Actions performed:**
1. Reads current project plan and requirements context
2. Generates comprehensive final documentation covering all implementation aspects
3. Saves documentation with proper naming convention
4. Creates descriptive commit message based on completed work
5. Prepares all three documents for archival

### Enhanced TASK COMPLETE Command

The `TASK COMPLETE` command now orchestrates the complete documentation triad:

```
TASK COMPLETE
```

**Actions performed:**
1. Verifies all project plan checkboxes are completed
2. Runs `DOCUMENT WORK` to create final documentation
3. Creates monthly archive folder structure
4. Archives all three documents with proper naming:
   - Project plan (original name)
   - Requirements context (context- prefix)  
   - Final documentation (documentation- prefix)
5. Commits all three documents together
6. Provides completion summary

## üìÅ File Naming Convention

```
ai-contexts/project-plans/completed/2025-10/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ projectplan-TICKET-123-user-authentication-2025-10-24.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ context-TICKET-123-user-authentication.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ documentation-TICKET-123-user-authentication.md
```

## üéØ Benefits

### Knowledge Retention
- **Complete Context:** All three perspectives preserved (plan, requirements, implementation)
- **Decision History:** Why decisions were made, not just what was built
- **Lessons Learned:** Challenges and solutions captured for future reference

### Team Collaboration
- **Onboarding:** New team members can understand complete context
- **Handoffs:** Complete knowledge transfer without information loss
- **Reviews:** Full context available for code reviews and retrospectives

### Future Reference
- **Similar Tasks:** Use as templates for similar work
- **Debugging:** Understand original implementation decisions
- **Maintenance:** Clear maintenance notes and considerations

### Compliance & Audit
- **Complete Trail:** Full documentation of requirements ‚Üí planning ‚Üí implementation
- **Accountability:** Clear record of decisions and rationale
- **Quality Assurance:** Comprehensive testing and coverage documentation

## üöÄ Using the System

### 1. During Development
Focus on your current work using the existing workflow commands:
- `TASK START` ‚Üí `START` ‚Üí `TASK UPDATE` ‚Üí `TASK STATUS`

### 2. Before Completion
Run the enhanced documentation commands:
```
DOCUMENT WORK  # Creates final documentation + commit message
```

### 3. Task Completion
Complete with the comprehensive archival:
```
TASK COMPLETE  # Archives all three documents together
```

### 4. Finding Past Work
Use search commands to find complete knowledge base entries:
```
FIND WORK authentication  # Finds all three docs for authentication work
SUMMARY MONTH            # Shows all completed triads this month
```

## üìä Example Documentation Triad

### Project Plan (Execution Roadmap)
```markdown
# Project Plan: User Authentication System

## Phase 1: Database Schema ‚úì
- [x] Create users table with email, password_hash
- [x] Add JWT token expiration (24 hours)
- [x] Add rate limiting fields

## Phase 2: Authentication Endpoints ‚úì
- [x] POST /auth/register endpoint
- [x] POST /auth/login with rate limiting
- [x] Password strength validation
```

### Requirements Context (Original Requirements)
```markdown
# User Authentication Requirements

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to register with email/password
- As a user, I want to login securely
- As a system, I want to prevent brute force attacks

## Acceptance Criteria
- Passwords must be min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number
- JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
- Rate limiting: 5 failed attempts = lockout
```

### Final Documentation (Implementation Summary)
```markdown
# Authentication System Implementation Summary

## Executive Summary
Built secure user authentication with JWT tokens, password validation, 
and rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks.

## Technical Implementation
- Used bcrypt for password hashing (cost factor 12)
- JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration
- Redis for rate limiting storage
- PostgreSQL for user data

## Key Decisions
- Chose JWT over sessions for stateless scalability
- Implemented sliding window rate limiting vs fixed window
- Added password strength validation on both client and server

## Challenges Overcome
- Rate limiting across multiple server instances using Redis
- Proper error messages without revealing user existence
- Secure password reset flow design

## Performance Impact
- Login endpoint: ~150ms average response time
- Registration: ~200ms (due to bcrypt hashing)
- Memory usage: +15MB for Redis connection pool

## Future Maintenance
- Monitor JWT secret rotation (recommend quarterly)
- Consider implementing MFA for admin accounts
- Review rate limiting thresholds based on usage patterns

## Lessons Learned
- Always test rate limiting with concurrent requests
- Password validation UX is critical for user adoption
- Redis connection pooling essential for performance
```

## üîß Customization

### Template Customization
You can customize the final documentation template by modifying the `DOCUMENT WORK` command or creating team-specific documentation standards in your `custom/` contexts.

### Archive Organization
The system organizes by month (`YYYY-MM/`) but you can extend this for quarterly or project-based organization by modifying the archival commands.

### Search and Discovery
Use `FIND WORK` and summary commands to discover and reuse past documentation triads for similar future work.

## üìà Metrics and Value

### Knowledge Base Growth
- **Complete Entries:** Every task generates three complementary documents
- **Searchable History:** Full-text search across all implementation details
- **Template Library:** Past work becomes templates for future projects

### Team Productivity
- **Reduced Research Time:** Complete context available for similar future work
- **Faster Onboarding:** New team members can study complete implementation examples
- **Better Decisions:** Learn from past challenges and solutions

### Quality Improvement
- **Consistency:** Similar problems solved with similar approaches
- **Best Practices:** Lessons learned are captured and reusable
- **Risk Reduction:** Past challenges and solutions inform future work

This three-document approach transforms every completed task into a valuable knowledge base entry that serves the team long into the future.
