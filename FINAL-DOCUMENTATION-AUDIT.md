## 🔍 Cross-Document Consistency Checks

### Two-Phase Workflow Consistency

| Document | TASK START Explained | START Explained | Consistent |
|----------|---------------------|-----------------|------------|
| README.md | ✅ Clear | ✅ Clear | ✅ |
| master-context.md | ✅ Detailed | ✅ Detailed | ✅ |
| code-workflow.md | ✅ Implied | ✅ Detailed | ✅ |
| quick-start.md | ✅ Simple | ✅ Simple | ✅ |

**Result:** All documents consistently explain the two-phase workflow.

---

### Installation Workflow Consistency

| Document | Permanent Clone | Update Process | Backup Mentioned |
|----------|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| README.md | ✅ ~/ai-dev-workflow | ✅ git pull → re-run | ✅ Auto-backup |
| installation.md | ✅ ~/ai-dev-workflow | ✅ Detailed | ✅ Timestamped |

**Result:** Installation and update workflow consistently documented.

---

### Command References Consistency

| Command | README | master-context | workflow-ref | VS Code |
|---------|--------|----------------|--------------|---------|
| TASK START | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ task-start |
| START | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ (intentional) | ✅ start |
| TASK UPDATE | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ task-update |
| TASK COMPLETE | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ task-complete |
| TASK STATUS | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ task-status |
| MOVE USER CONTEXT | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ move-context |
| DOCUMENT WORK | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ document-work |
| SHOW COMMANDS | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ show-commands |

**Note:** START intentionally not in workflow-commands-reference (it's part of TASK START).
**Note:** Advanced commands not in README (appropriate for main doc simplicity).

**Result:** Core commands consistently referenced, advanced commands appropriately scoped.

---

### VS Code Snippet Naming Consistency

| Location | Prefix Format | Matches Actual |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| README.md | kebab-case | ✅ All correct |
| quick-start.md | kebab-case | ✅ All correct |
| Snippet file | kebab-case | ✅ Source of truth |
