# AI Workflow Command Framework

This document defines standardized commands that users can give to AI to perform common workflow operations efficiently.

## üéØ Command Philosophy

Instead of explaining the full workflow every time, users can use simple commands that AI understands and executes consistently. This makes the workflow faster and more predictable.

## üìã Core Commands Reference

### **Session Management Commands**

#### `RESUME`
**Purpose:** Restore AI session after interruption, computer shutdown, or team handoff
**AI Actions:**
1. Load core contexts (`master-context.md`, `code-workflow.md`)
2. Find active project plan in `ai-contexts/project-plans/active/`
3. Read requirements context from `ai-contexts/wip/`
4. Analyze completed ([x]) vs pending ([ ]) tasks
5. Identify current phase and next task
6. Review recent git commits (last 10) for context
7. Auto-detect and load relevant contexts based on project type
8. Check requirements-plan sync status
9. Present comprehensive status summary
10. Ask how to proceed (CONTINUE, REVIEW, REPLAN, TEST)

**Variants:**
- `RESUME` - Resume most recent active project
- `RESUME {ticket}` - Resume specific project by ticket (e.g., `RESUME TICKET-123`)
- `RESUME {filename}` - Resume by exact project plan filename

**Example:**
```
User: "RESUME"
AI: üîÑ Resuming AI Development Session...

    üìö Contexts Loaded:
    ‚úÖ master-context.md
    ‚úÖ code-workflow.md
    ‚úÖ backend-api-context.md (auto-detected)

    üìã Active Project: TICKET-123 User Authentication
    üìä Progress: 60% (12/20 tasks)
    üéØ Current Phase: Phase 3 - JWT Implementation
    ‚è≥ Next Task: Task 3.3 - Create token refresh endpoint

    ‚úÖ Session restored! Ready to continue.

    How would you like to proceed?
    1. CONTINUE - Resume implementation
    2. REVIEW - Review completed work
    3. REPLAN - Make changes to plan
    4. TEST - Run tests on completed work
```

## üí° Command Best Practices

### **For Users:**
- Use commands consistently for predictable results
- Check `TASK STATUS` regularly to track progress
- Use `FIND WORK` before starting similar tasks
- Archive with `TASK COMPLETE` when truly done

### **For AI:**
- Always confirm command understood before executing
- Provide clear status updates during execution
- Show file locations and git commands used
- Ask for confirmation on destructive operations (delete, move)
- Generate descriptive commit messages
- Maintain consistent file naming conventions

### **Error Handling:**
- If command unclear, ask for clarification
- If files missing, suggest alternatives
- If git operations fail, provide troubleshooting
- Always confirm successful completion

## üéØ Command Integration

### **VS Code Snippets**
All commands available as VS Code snippets with `ai-` prefix:
- Type `task-complete` ‚Üí expands to full command
- Includes placeholders for customization
- Works with GitHub Copilot Chat integration

### **Context Integration**
Commands reference this document in `master-context.md`:
- AI learns command patterns and behaviors
- Consistent execution across different AI sessions
- Extensible for project-specific commands

### **Shell Scripts** (Future)
Planned executable commands:
- `ai-task-complete` ‚Üí runs full workflow
- `ai-task-status` ‚Üí shows current progress
- `ai-find-work keyword` ‚Üí searches completed work
