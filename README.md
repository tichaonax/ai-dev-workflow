## 🎯 What Problem Does This Solve?

AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot, Claude, and ChatGPT are powerful—but without structure, they:
- ❌ Make wrong assumptions about your codebase
- ❌ Skip planning and dive straight into coding
- ❌ Create inconsistent patterns across your team
- ❌ Generate code without documentation
- ❌ Introduce bugs that take hours to debug

**Result:** Technical debt accumulates, code quality suffers, and teams waste time fixing AI-generated mistakes.

---

## ✅ Our Solution: Get a GRIP on AI

A comprehensive workflow system that makes AI assistants:
- ✅ **Learn your standards** through context documents (Right Context)
- ✅ **Plan before coding** with mandatory approval gates (Right Process)
- ✅ **Work consistently** using specialized templates (Right Process)
- ✅ **Create documentation** automatically for every task (Right Results)
- ✅ **Prevent mistakes** through incremental implementation (Right Results)

**Result:** 80% less rework, 100% documentation, near-zero breaking changes, and knowledge that persists beyond individual developers.

> **GRIP Principle:** Give AI the right context → Implement the right process → Get the right results

---

## 🚀 Quick Example

### Without this workflow:
```
Developer: "Add authentication to the API"
AI: *Starts coding immediately*
Result: Wrong library, missing edge cases, no tests, no docs
Time wasted: 4 hours of debugging and rework
```

### With this workflow:
```
Developer: Fills feature-development template, provides to AI
AI: Loads contexts → Creates detailed project plan → WAITS for approval
Developer: Reviews plan, approves
AI: Implements Phase 1 → Shows results → WAITS for approval
Developer: Reviews implementation, approves next phase
Result: Correct implementation, complete docs, no rework
Time saved: ~3 hours
```

---

## 📊 Proven Results

Real metrics from teams using this workflow:

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Rework time | 5 hours/task | 1 hour/task | **80% reduction** |
| Documentation | 60% complete | 100% complete | **100% coverage** |
| Breaking changes | 5-10 per month | <1 per month | **90% reduction** |
| Onboarding time | 2 weeks | 1 week | **50% faster** |

## 🚀 Get Started in 5 Minutes

### Option 1: Quick Install with Installer (Recommended)

**Step 1: Clone this repository (keep it for updates and contributions)**
```bash
# Clone the AI workflow repository to a permanent location
git clone https://github.com/tichaonax/ai-dev-workflow.git ~/ai-dev-workflow
cd ~/ai-dev-workflow
```

**Step 2: Run the installer to copy files to your project(s)**
```bash
# Run installer to copy minimal files to your project
chmod +x install-ai-workflow.sh
./install-ai-workflow.sh /path/to/your/existing-project

# Example (dry-run preview first):
./install-ai-workflow.sh --dry-run /path/to/your/existing-project

# Available flags: --dry-run, --yes (-y), --list-templates
```

**Step 3: Get updates (when new versions are released)**
```bash
# Pull latest updates from the repository
cd ~/ai-dev-workflow
git pull

# Re-run installer to update your project(s)
./install-ai-workflow.sh /path/to/your/existing-project
# Installer will detect existing installation, backup, and update
```

**Why keep the clone?**
- Get updates easily with `git pull` → re-run installer
- Contribute improvements via Pull Requests
- Install to multiple projects from same source
- No need to re-clone for each update

The installer copies only the essential files (`contexts/`, `templates/`, `integrations/`) to your project's `ai-contexts/` directory. When updating, it automatically backs up your existing `ai-contexts/` before installing fresh files.

---

### Option 2: Clone Directly Into Your Project

Clone the repository directly into your project as `ai-contexts/`:

```bash
# Navigate to your project root
cd /path/to/your/project

# Clone into ai-contexts directory
git clone https://github.com/tichaonax/ai-dev-workflow.git ai-contexts

# (Optional) Remove git history to make it part of your project
cd ai-contexts
rm -rf .git
cd ..
git add ai-contexts/
git commit -m "Add AI workflow system"
```

---

### Option 3: Download ZIP

1. Download ZIP from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/tichaonax/ai-dev-workflow/releases)
2. Extract to `ai-contexts/` in your project
3. Follow [Quick Start Guide](docs/quick-start.md)

**Full installation guide:** [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md)

**Optional: Install VS Code Snippets**
```bash
# Copy snippets to your project (after installation)
cp ai-contexts/integrations/vscode/ai-workflow-commands.code-snippets .vscode/
# Restart VS Code to activate snippets
```

---

## 🤖 First Time AI Training

**Important:** AI assistants only learn the workflow commands AFTER reading the context files. Here's how to bootstrap:

### Method 1: Manual Context Loading (Recommended)
```
👋 Hi Claude/ChatGPT! Please read these files to learn our workflow:

📖 ai-contexts/contexts/master-context.md
📖 ai-contexts/contexts/code-workflow.md

These files teach you our two-phase workflow:
1. TASK START (template selection & requirements gathering)
2. START (project plan creation & execution)

Once you've read them, help me with: TASK START PROJECT-123 user-authentication
```

### Method 2: Use VS Code Snippets (Instant Access)

**First, install the snippets:**
1. Open VS Code in your project directory
2. Copy `ai-contexts/integrations/vscode/ai-workflow-commands.code-snippets` 
3. Place it in your project's `.vscode/` directory (create if it doesn't exist)
4. Restart VS Code or reload the window

**Then use the snippets:**
- Type `ai-train` + Tab → AI training message (first time setup)
- Type `task-start` + Tab → Full TASK START command
- Type `start` + Tab → START command (after filling requirements)
- Type `sync-req` + Tab → SYNC REQUIREMENTS command (NEW!)
- Type `replan` + Tab → REPLAN command (NEW!)
- Type `approve-plan` + Tab → APPROVE PLAN command (NEW!)
- Type `plan-status` + Tab → PLAN STATUS command (NEW!)
- Type `task-status` + Tab → TASK STATUS command
- Type `move-context` + Tab → MOVE USER CONTEXT command
- Type `task-complete` + Tab → TASK COMPLETE command

### Method 3: Copy-Paste Commands
```bash
# Essential commands you can copy-paste:

# Phase 1: Setup & Requirements
TASK START <ticket-id> <short-description>  # Choose template, create context file
# (Fill in your requirements in the context file)
START                                       # Create project plan & begin work

# Requirements-Plan Synchronization (NEW!)
SYNC REQUIREMENTS                           # Update requirements to match plan
REPLAN                                      # Re-analyze requirements, update plan
APPROVE PLAN                                # Lock plan and begin implementation
PLAN STATUS                                 # Check sync status

# Progress Management
TASK STATUS                                 # Check progress
TASK UPDATE                                 # Mark completed tasks
TASK COMPLETE                               # Archive completed project
MOVE USER CONTEXT                           # Archive context file
```

**💡 Pro Tip:** After the first session, AI will remember the commands for the rest of that conversation!

## 🎬 How It Works

### The Workflow (4 Steps)

| Step | What Happens | Key Actions |
|:----:|:-------------|:------------|
| **1. Load Contexts** | AI reads your standards and conventions | • `master-context.md` - Core principles<br>• `code-workflow.md` - Workflow rules<br>• Your custom contexts - Project standards |
| **2. Create Plan** | AI creates detailed project plan with approval gates | • All 8 required sections included<br>• To-Do Checklist with atomic tasks<br>• Risk Assessment & Rollback Plan<br>⏸️ **Wait for approval** before coding |
| **3. Sync Requirements** | Requirements and plan are synchronized | • **SYNC REQUIREMENTS** - Update requirements to match plan<br>• **REPLAN** - Update plan based on new requirements<br>• **APPROVE PLAN** - Lock both for implementation<br>⏸️ **Ensures QA has complete requirements** |
| **4. Implement** | AI codes incrementally, phase by phase | • Implements Phase 1 with tests<br>⏸️ **Wait for approval** after each phase<br>• Updates checkboxes as tasks complete<br>• Repeats until all phases done |

### Example Session (Complete Workflow with Sync)

```markdown
YOU: Load master-context.md and code-workflow.md first.
     Then: TASK START PROJECT-123 user-authentication

AI:  ✅ Contexts loaded!

     📋 Choose a template:
     1. 🆕 feature-development (recommended for user-authentication)
     2. 🐛 debugging
     3. ♻️ refactor-optimization
     [... more templates ...]

YOU: 1

AI:  ✅ Created context file: ai-contexts/wip/PROJECT-123-user-authentication.md

     Please fill in your requirements and type START when ready.

YOU: [Fills basic requirements in context file]
     START

AI:  ✅ Reading requirements...

     📋 PROJECT PLAN CREATED:
     Phase 1: Create user model and database schema
       - Task 1.1: Create users table with email, password_hash columns
       - Task 1.2: Add JWT token expiration (24 hours)
     Phase 2: Implement authentication endpoints (login, register)
       - Task 2.1: POST /auth/register endpoint
       - Task 2.2: POST /auth/login endpoint with rate limiting (5 attempts)
     Phase 3: Add JWT token generation and validation
     Phase 4: Write unit tests and integration tests

     ⏸️ Plan created. Review and make changes, or continue with sync.

YOU: What about password requirements?

AI:  Good catch! I'll add password validation requirements:
     - Minimum 8 characters
     - At least 1 uppercase letter
     - At least 1 number
     Updated plan with Task 2.3: Add password strength validation.

YOU: Perfect! SYNC REQUIREMENTS

AI:  📋 Syncing requirements with project plan...

     ✅ Added to requirements (wip/PROJECT-123-user-authentication.md):
     - JWT token expiration: 24 hours
     - Password requirements: min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number
     - Rate limiting: 5 failed login attempts = lockout
     - Database schema: users table with email, password_hash, locked_until columns

     ✅ Requirements now match project plan!

YOU: APPROVE PLAN

AI:  ✅ Synchronization verified!
     🔒 Plan approved and locked!

     🚀 Starting Phase 1: Database Schema

     ⏸️ Approval required to begin implementation.

YOU: Proceed with Phase 1.

AI:  🔧 Implementing Phase 1...
     [Shows code changes]
     ✅ Phase 1 complete.

     ⏸️ Approval required for Phase 2.

YOU: Phase 1 approved. Proceed with Phase 2.

[... continues with approvals ...]

AI:  ✅ All phases complete!
     - Code implemented with requirements
     - Tests passing
     - Documentation generated
     - Project plan updated
     - Requirements synchronized for QA
```
