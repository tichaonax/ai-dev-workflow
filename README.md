## 🎯 What Problem Does This Solve?

AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot, Claude, and ChatGPT are powerful—but without structure, they:
- ❌ Make wrong assumptions about your codebase
- ❌ Skip planning and dive straight into coding
- ❌ Create inconsistent patterns across your team
- ❌ Generate code without documentation
- ❌ Introduce bugs that take hours to debug

**Result:** Technical debt accumulates, code quality suffers, and teams waste time fixing AI-generated mistakes.

---

## ✅ Our Solution: Get a GRIP on AI

A comprehensive workflow system that makes AI assistants:
- ✅ **Learn your standards** through context documents (Right Context)
- ✅ **Plan before coding** with mandatory approval gates (Right Process)
- ✅ **Work consistently** using specialized templates (Right Process)
- ✅ **Create documentation** automatically for every task (Right Results)
- ✅ **Prevent mistakes** through incremental implementation (Right Results)

**Result:** 80% less rework, 100% documentation, near-zero breaking changes, and knowledge that persists beyond individual developers.

> **GRIP Principle:** Give AI the right context → Implement the right process → Get the right results

---

## 🚀 Quick Example

### Without this workflow:
```
Developer: "Add authentication to the API"
AI: *Starts coding immediately*
Result: Wrong library, missing edge cases, no tests, no docs
Time wasted: 4 hours of debugging and rework
```

### With this workflow:
```
Developer: Fills feature-development template, provides to AI
AI: Loads contexts → Creates detailed project plan → WAITS for approval
Developer: Reviews plan, approves
AI: Implements Phase 1 → Shows results → WAITS for approval
Developer: Reviews implementation, approves next phase
Result: Correct implementation, complete docs, no rework
Time saved: ~3 hours
```

## 🚀 Get Started in 5 Minutes

### Option 1: Quick Install with Installer (Recommended)

**Step 1: Clone this repository (keep it for updates and contributions)**
```bash
# Clone the AI workflow repository to a permanent location
git clone https://github.com/tichaonax/ai-dev-workflow.git ~/ai-dev-workflow
cd ~/ai-dev-workflow
```

**Step 2: Run the installer to copy files to your project(s)**
```bash
# Run installer to copy minimal files to your project
chmod +x install-ai-workflow.sh
./install-ai-workflow.sh /path/to/your/existing-project

# Example (dry-run preview first):
./install-ai-workflow.sh --dry-run /path/to/your/existing-project

# Available flags: --dry-run, --yes (-y), --list-templates
```

**Step 3: Get updates (when new versions are released)**
```bash
# Pull latest updates from the repository
cd ~/ai-dev-workflow
git pull

# Re-run installer to update your project(s)
./install-ai-workflow.sh /path/to/your/existing-project
# Installer will detect existing installation, backup, and update
```

**Why keep the clone?**
- Get updates easily with `git pull` → re-run installer
- Contribute improvements via Pull Requests
- Install to multiple projects from same source
- No need to re-clone for each update

The installer copies only the essential files (`contexts/`, `templates/`, `integrations/`) to your project's `ai-contexts/` directory. When updating, it automatically:
- Backs up your existing `ai-contexts/` directory with timestamp
- Installs fresh framework files 
- **Preserves your work:** custom templates, work-in-progress sessions, project plans, and team contexts

---

### Option 2: Clone Directly Into Your Project

Clone the repository directly into your project as `ai-contexts/`:

```bash
# Navigate to your project root
cd /path/to/your/project

# Clone into ai-contexts directory
git clone https://github.com/tichaonax/ai-dev-workflow.git ai-contexts

# (Optional) Remove git history to make it part of your project
cd ai-contexts
rm -rf .git
cd ..
git add ai-contexts/
git commit -m "Add AI workflow system"
```

---

## 🤖 First Time AI Training

**Important:** AI assistants only learn the workflow commands AFTER reading the context files. Here's how to bootstrap:

### Method 1: Manual Context Loading (Recommended)
```
👋 Hi! Please read these files to learn our AI development workflow:

📖 ai-contexts/contexts/master-context.md
📖 ai-contexts/contexts/code-workflow.md
📖 ai-contexts/custom/*.md (if any team-specific contexts exist)

These files teach you:
- RESUME: Continue existing work after interruptions/handoffs
- TASK START: Begin new feature or task
- START: Create project plan and begin implementation
- Approval checkpoints and project plan tracking
- Team-specific standards and conventions (from custom/)

What would you like to do?
• RESUME - Continue existing work
• TASK START <ticket> <description> - Start new work
```

### Method 2: Use VS Code Snippets (Instant Access)

**First, install the snippets:**
1. Open VS Code in your project directory
2. Copy `ai-contexts/integrations/vscode/ai-workflow-commands.code-snippets` 
3. Place it in your project's `.vscode/` directory (create if it doesn't exist)
4. Restart VS Code or reload the window

**Then use the snippets:**
- Type `ai-train` + Tab → AI training message (first time setup)
- Type `resume` + Tab → RESUME command (session restoration)
- Type `task-start` + Tab → Full TASK START command
- Type `start` + Tab → START command (after filling requirements)
- Type `compare-req` + Tab → COMPARE REQUIREMENTS command (NEW!)
- Type `sync-req` + Tab → SYNC REQUIREMENTS command
- Type `replan` + Tab → REPLAN command
- Type `approve-plan` + Tab → APPROVE PLAN command
- Type `plan-status` + Tab → PLAN STATUS command
- Type `task-status` + Tab → TASK STATUS command
- Type `move-context` + Tab → MOVE USER CONTEXT command
- Type `task-complete` + Tab → TASK COMPLETE command
- Type `show-commands` + Tab → SHOW COMMANDS (list all commands)
- Type `show-snippets` + Tab → SHOW SNIPPETS (list all snippets) (NEW!)

### Method 3: Copy-Paste Commands
```bash
# Essential commands you can copy-paste:

## 📖 Core Concepts: Sessions & Templates

Understanding the fundamental building blocks of this workflow system:

### 🎯 What is a Session?

A **session** is a bounded conversational interaction between you and an AI system, initiated around a specific problem or context. It maintains continuity of thought, state, and reference materials until the objective is resolved or naturally concludes.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Bounded scope** - Focused on solving one specific problem or task
- **Maintains continuity** - Preserves conversation history, decisions, and progress
- **Context-driven** - Initiated with a specific problem domain in mind
- **Traceable** - All inputs, outputs, and intermediate steps are documented
- **Fundamental unit** - The basic building block of structured AI collaboration

**In Practice:**
When you run `TASK START TICKET-123 user-authentication`, you're creating a session:
- **Session artifact:** `ai-contexts/wip/TICKET-123-user-authentication.md` (your requirements)
- **Session plan:** `ai-contexts/project-plans/active/projectplan-TICKET-123-user-authentication-2025-10-24.md`
- **Session scope:** Everything related to implementing user authentication
- **Session lifecycle:** From `TASK START` through implementation to `TASK COMPLETE`

### 📋 What is a Session Template?

A **session template** is a predefined conversational framework that structures how an AI engages with a particular type of problem domain. It includes context initialization, role definitions, prompt scaffolding, and guidelines for expected behavior.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Domain-specific** - Optimized for a particular type of problem (debugging, features, refactoring, etc.)
- **Reusable configuration** - Preloads domain knowledge and behavioral parameters
- **Structured framework** - Guides AI reasoning patterns for that domain
- **Consistency enforcer** - Ensures similar problems are approached similarly
- **Best practices embedded** - Captures proven patterns for each domain

**Available Templates:**

| Template | Problem Domain | When to Use |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| **feature-development-session.md** | New features, screens, components | Building new functionality |
| **debugging-session.md** | Bug analysis and resolution | Investigating and fixing bugs |
| **refactor-optimization-session.md** | Code improvements, performance | Improving existing code |
| **database-schema-session.md** | Database changes, migrations | Schema design and changes |
| **api-endpoint-session.md** | API development and updates | REST/GraphQL endpoints |
| **design-review-session.md** | UI/UX review and implementation | Design implementation |
| **documentation-session.md** | Technical documentation | Writing docs |
| **security-review-session.md** | Security audits and fixes | Security analysis |
| **init-session.md** | General exploration | Exploratory work |

**In Practice:**
When you choose template #1 during `TASK START`:
- Template **preloads** feature development best practices
- AI knows to ask about **user stories, success criteria, edge cases**
- Session follows **feature-specific workflow** (requirements → design → implement → test)
- Output format matches **feature documentation standards**

### 🔄 How Sessions and Templates Work Together

```
1. User: TASK START TICKET-456 payment-gateway-integration

2. AI: Shows 9 session templates to choose from

3. User: Selects "api-endpoint-session.md" (Template #5)

4. AI: Creates session context file with API-specific prompts:
   - What API endpoints are needed?
   - What's the request/response format?
   - What authentication is required?
   - What error handling is needed?

5. User: Fills requirements in the session context

6. User: START (creates project plan from template's framework)

7. Session runs: AI follows API-specific workflow patterns

8. Session ends: TASK COMPLETE (archives session artifacts)
```

**Why This Matters:**
- ✅ **Consistency** - Similar problems solved similarly across your team
- ✅ **Efficiency** - Don't re-explain domain context every time
- ✅ **Quality** - Best practices embedded in every session type
- ✅ **Onboarding** - New team members see proven patterns
- ✅ **Knowledge capture** - Sessions become searchable knowledge base

**Developer-Focused Definition:**

> **Session:** A runtime scope maintaining context and conversation history between user and AI for a defined problem-solving task (e.g., debugging network code, designing ESP32 mesh protocol, optimizing React performance).

> **Session Template:** A reusable configuration that preloads domain knowledge, context, and behavioral parameters — such as "Embedded Systems Debugging," "React Frontend Optimization," or "Database Migration Planning." Ensures the AI operates within the intended reasoning pattern for that domain.

## 📚 Quick Tour

### 1. Context Documents (`contexts/`)

Teach AI your coding standards:

```markdown
contexts/
├── master-context.md          # Core principles (LOAD FIRST)
├── code-workflow.md           # Workflow rules (LOAD SECOND)
├── general-problem-solving-context.md
├── backend/
│   ├── backend-api-context.md
│   └── database-schema-context.md
└── frontend/
    ├── component-context.md
    ├── styling-context.md
    └── unit-testing-context.md
```

### 2. Session Templates (`templates/v1/`)

Pre-configured templates for different tasks:

```markdown
templates/v1/
├── feature-development-session.md
├── debugging-session.md
├── refactor-optimization-session.md
├── database-schema-session.md
├── api-endpoint-session.md
├── design-review-session.md
├── documentation-session.md
├── security-review-session.md
└── init-session.md
```

### 3. Real Examples (`examples/`)

Learn from complete workflows:

```markdown
examples/
├── feature-development/
│   ├── EXAMPLE-feature-development-leave-request.md
│   └── expense-categories-emoji-system.md
├── debugging/
│   └── EXAMPLE-debugging-revenue-bug.md
├── refactoring/
│   └── EXAMPLE-refactor-optimization-dashboard.md
└── ...more
```

## 🎬 How It Works

### The Workflow (4 Steps)

| Step | What Happens | Key Actions |
|:----:|:-------------|:------------|
| **1. Load Contexts** | AI reads your standards and conventions | • `master-context.md` - Core principles<br>• `code-workflow.md` - Workflow rules<br>• Your custom contexts - Project standards |
| **2. Create Plan** | AI creates detailed project plan with approval gates | • All 8 required sections included<br>• To-Do Checklist with atomic tasks<br>• Risk Assessment & Rollback Plan<br>⏸️ **Wait for approval** before coding |
| **3. Sync Requirements** | Requirements and plan are synchronized | • **SYNC REQUIREMENTS** - Update requirements to match plan<br>• **REPLAN** - Update plan based on new requirements<br>• **APPROVE PLAN** - Lock both for implementation<br>⏸️ **Ensures QA has complete requirements** |
| **4. Implement** | AI codes incrementally, phase by phase | • Implements Phase 1 with tests<br>⏸️ **Wait for approval** after each phase<br>• Updates checkboxes as tasks complete<br>• Repeats until all phases done |

### Example Session (Complete Workflow with Sync)

```markdown
YOU: Load master-context.md and code-workflow.md first.
     Then: TASK START PROJECT-123 user-authentication

AI:  ✅ Contexts loaded!

     📋 Choose a template:
     1. 🆕 feature-development (recommended for user-authentication)
     2. 🐛 debugging
     3. ♻️ refactor-optimization
     [... more templates ...]

YOU: 1

AI:  ✅ Created context file: ai-contexts/wip/PROJECT-123-user-authentication.md

     Please fill in your requirements and type START when ready.

YOU: [Fills basic requirements in context file]
     START

AI:  ✅ Reading requirements...

     📋 PROJECT PLAN CREATED:
     Phase 1: Create user model and database schema
       - Task 1.1: Create users table with email, password_hash columns
       - Task 1.2: Add JWT token expiration (24 hours)
     Phase 2: Implement authentication endpoints (login, register)
       - Task 2.1: POST /auth/register endpoint
       - Task 2.2: POST /auth/login endpoint with rate limiting (5 attempts)
     Phase 3: Add JWT token generation and validation
     Phase 4: Write unit tests and integration tests

     ⏸️ Plan created. Review and make changes, or continue with sync.

YOU: What about password requirements?

AI:  Good catch! I'll add password validation requirements:
     - Minimum 8 characters
     - At least 1 uppercase letter
     - At least 1 number
     Updated plan with Task 2.3: Add password strength validation.

YOU: Perfect! SYNC REQUIREMENTS

AI:  📋 Syncing requirements with project plan...

     ✅ Added to requirements (wip/PROJECT-123-user-authentication.md):
     - JWT token expiration: 24 hours
     - Password requirements: min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number
     - Rate limiting: 5 failed login attempts = lockout
     - Database schema: users table with email, password_hash, locked_until columns

     ✅ Requirements now match project plan!

YOU: APPROVE PLAN

AI:  ✅ Synchronization verified!
     🔒 Plan approved and locked!

     🚀 Starting Phase 1: Database Schema

     ⏸️ Approval required to begin implementation.

YOU: Proceed with Phase 1.

AI:  🔧 Implementing Phase 1...
     [Shows code changes]
     ✅ Phase 1 complete.

     ⏸️ Approval required for Phase 2.

YOU: Phase 1 approved. Proceed with Phase 2.

[... continues with approvals ...]

AI:  ✅ All phases complete!
     - Code implemented with requirements
     - Tests passing
     - Documentation generated
     - Project plan updated
     - Requirements synchronized for QA
```
