# Project Plan: EXAMPLE-123 - Add Command Framework

**Ticket:** EXAMPLE-123  
**Created:** 2025-10-21  
**Type:** Feature Development  
**Status:** Active  

## üìã Overview

Add a standardized command framework to the AI workflow system that allows users to type simple commands like "TASK COMPLETE" and have the AI perform structured operations.

### Objectives
- Implement VS Code snippets for common workflow commands
- Create safe POSIX shell scripts with dry-run defaults
- Add comprehensive logging and status reporting
- Maintain human oversight for all destructive operations

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can type "TASK COMPLETE" and get structured AI response
- [ ] Scripts default to dry-run mode for safety
- [ ] All file operations are logged
- [ ] Documentation includes usage examples

## üìÅ Files to Modify

### New Files
- [ ] `integrations/vscode/ai-workflow-commands.code-snippets`
- [ ] `tools/ai-task-complete` (POSIX shell script)
- [ ] `tools/ai-move-context` (POSIX shell script)  
- [ ] `tools/ai-task-status` (POSIX shell script)
- [ ] `ai-contexts/project-plans/active/` (directory)
- [ ] `ai-contexts/project-plans/completed/` (directory)

### Modified Files
- [ ] `contexts/master-context.md` (add command definitions)
- [ ] `docs/WORKFLOW-COMMANDS.md` (update with examples)

## üéØ Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- [x] Create VS Code snippets file with basic commands
- [x] Add command definitions to master-context.md
- [x] Create project-plans directory structure
- [ ] Test snippet expansion in VS Code

### Phase 2: Shell Scripts
- [x] Implement ai-task-complete with dry-run safety
- [x] Implement ai-move-context with logging
- [x] Implement ai-task-status as read-only
- [ ] Make all scripts executable and test dry-run mode
- [ ] Verify error handling and edge cases

### Phase 3: Documentation & Testing
- [ ] Add usage examples to docs/WORKFLOW-COMMANDS.md
- [ ] Create smoke tests for each script
- [ ] Test end-to-end workflow with example plan
- [ ] Update README with command framework info

### Phase 4: Integration & Rollout
- [ ] Add commands to existing workflow documentation
- [ ] Create video/tutorial showing command usage
- [ ] Get feedback from early users
- [ ] Refine based on usage patterns

## üìä Impact Assessment

### Positive Impact
- **Developer Experience**: Much simpler to use common workflow operations
- **Consistency**: Standardized commands ensure consistent AI behavior
- **Safety**: Dry-run defaults prevent accidental operations
- **Auditability**: All operations are logged for review

### Risk Mitigation
- **Dry-run by default**: All scripts require explicit --yes flag
- **Logging**: Complete audit trail of all operations
- **Validation**: Scripts check file existence and git repository status
- **Rollback**: Operations can be undone via git history

## ‚úÖ Task Checklist

### Development Tasks
- [x] Design command interface and safety model
- [x] Create VS Code snippets for all major commands
- [x] Implement ai-task-complete script with full functionality
- [x] Implement ai-move-context script with validation
- [x] Implement ai-task-status script with progress display
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Create logging framework in tools/logs/
- [ ] Test all scripts in dry-run mode

### Documentation Tasks
- [x] Update contexts/master-context.md with command definitions
- [ ] Add usage examples to docs/WORKFLOW-COMMANDS.md
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Document command framework in main README

### Testing Tasks
- [ ] Smoke test each script with valid inputs
- [ ] Test error conditions and edge cases
- [ ] Verify dry-run mode never modifies files
- [ ] Test --yes mode performs expected operations
- [ ] Validate logging output and format

### Integration Tasks
- [ ] Add snippets to existing VS Code configuration
- [ ] Update install-ai-workflow.sh to include scripts
- [ ] Test integration with existing workflow
- [ ] Gather feedback from initial users

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Script argument parsing works correctly
- File validation catches missing files
- Dry-run mode shows correct operations
- Logging captures all activities

### Integration Tests  
- End-to-end workflow: TASK START ‚Üí TASK UPDATE ‚Üí TASK COMPLETE
- Git operations work correctly
- Directory creation works as expected
- Error conditions are handled gracefully

### User Acceptance Tests
- Commands are intuitive and easy to use
- Error messages are helpful and actionable
- Dry-run output clearly shows what would happen
- Performance is acceptable for typical usage

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If issues arise with the command framework:

1. **Immediate**: Revert master-context.md changes
2. **Short-term**: Remove or disable problematic scripts
3. **Long-term**: Fall back to manual workflow processes

All scripts are designed to be completely optional - existing workflow continues to work without them.

## üëÄ Review Checklist

### Code Review
- [ ] Scripts follow POSIX shell standards
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Logging is complete and useful
- [ ] Dry-run mode is thoroughly tested
- [ ] Documentation is clear and complete

### Security Review
- [ ] No hardcoded paths or credentials
- [ ] All user inputs are validated
- [ ] File operations are safe and contained
- [ ] Git operations are authorized by user

### User Experience Review
- [ ] Commands are intuitive and memorable
- [ ] Error messages are helpful
- [ ] Dry-run output is clear and actionable
- [ ] Performance meets user expectations
