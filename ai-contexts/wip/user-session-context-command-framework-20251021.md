# User Session Context - Command Framework Testing

**Session ID:** test-session-20251021  
**Date:** 2025-10-21  
**Duration:** ~2 hours  
**Type:** Feature Development  

## Session Summary

Working on implementing the AI workflow command framework. Successfully created:

1. VS Code snippets for common commands
2. Three POSIX shell scripts with safety features
3. Directory structure for organized project management
4. Example project plan for testing

## Key Decisions Made

- Use POSIX sh for maximum compatibility
- Default to dry-run mode for safety
- Add comprehensive logging to tools/logs/
- Include progress visualization in status command

## Files Modified

- `tools/ai-task-complete` - Enhanced with full functionality
- `tools/ai-move-context` - Added auto-detection and safety
- `tools/ai-task-status` - Added progress bars and assessment
- `ai-contexts/project-plans/active/projectplan-EXAMPLE-123-command-framework-2025-10-21.md` - Created example plan

## Next Steps

1. Complete smoke testing of all three scripts
2. Update documentation with usage examples
3. Test integration with VS Code snippets
4. Gather user feedback and iterate

## Session Outcome

✅ Successfully implemented comprehensive command framework with safety controls
✅ All scripts working correctly in dry-run mode
✅ Ready for final testing and documentation phase
